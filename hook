  # Post-deployment hook
  # Runs the curl command after all replicas have been updated
  # This hook will run after a successful deployment
  # and only once per deployment
  # Replace "curl" command with the command you want to run
  # You can use multiple hooks if needed
  # The pod runs in the same namespace as the deployment
  # and has access to the same resources as the deployment
  # For more information, see the Kubernetes documentation:
